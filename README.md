# BootcampX

## A mock SQL/Postgres application to learn database fundementals.

### Desription: 

#### At Lighthouse Labs, we've decided to create a new application to help manage data about students and mentors. The backend and front end development are being completely outsourced to alumni, but the database queries are going to be written by the current students at Lighthouse Labs. That means you.

### In this activity, we will:

* Setup the project
* Create a database
* Add some tables to the database
* Add some data to the tables

#### This will prepare us for writing queries in future activities.
